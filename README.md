# Disney-Account-Checker

Disney+ account checker ðŸ‘€, fast! Proxy required (free proxies work!)

## INSTALL THE IMPORTANT MODULES
Run `pip install requirements.txt`.

## SETTING UP PROXY
Put your proxies in `valid.txt`.

**Note:** Only put working ones. If you put bad ones, the checker will not work.

To get valid proxies:
1. Put all proxies in `pro.txt`.
2. Run `python proxy.py`.
3. You will now have good proxies in `valid.txt` easily.

## SETTING UP ACCOUNTS
Put your accounts in `acc.txt`.

## RUN THE MAIN FILE
Run `python main.py`.

Good accounts will be in the `checked` folder.
